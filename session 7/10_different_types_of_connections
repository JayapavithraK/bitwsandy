1. `AF_INET6`: This specifies the IPv6 address family, used for communication over IPv6.

   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_STREAM)


2. `AF_UNIX`: This specifies the Unix domain sockets, which are used for inter-process communication on the same host. This is not available on all platforms.

   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)


3. `AF_CAN`: This specifies the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol, used primarily in automotive and industrial applications.

   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_CAN, socket.SOCK_RAW)


4. `AF_PACKET`: This is used for low-level packet interface on the link layer, mainly for network protocol implementation and analysis.

   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW)


5. `AF_NETLINK`: This is used for communication between user space processes and kernel space processes in Linux.

   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_NETLINK, socket.SOCK_RAW)


6. `AF_BLUETOOTH`: This specifies the Bluetooth protocol stack, used for Bluetooth communication.

   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_BLUETOOTH, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
