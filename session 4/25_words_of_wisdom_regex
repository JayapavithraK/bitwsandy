        Regular expressions (regex) in Python are a powerful tool for pattern matching
and manipulation of strings. They provide a concise and flexible means for
identifying specific patterns within text data. Python's `re` module provides support
for regular expressions.

Here are some key aspects of regular expressions in Python:

1. Pattern Matching :
        Regular expressions allow you to define patterns to match against strings.
        These patterns can include literal characters, character classes (such as
        digits or letters), quantifiers (to specify repetition), and more.

2. Searching and Matching :
        Python's `re` module provides functions like `search()` and `match()` to
        search for patterns within strings. These functions return match objects
        if a match is found, allowing you to retrieve information about the match.

3. Substitution :
        Regular expressions can be used to substitute one pattern with another in
        a string. This is useful for tasks like find-and-replace operations.

4. Splitting :
        Regular expressions can be used to split strings based on a specified pattern.

5. Finding All Matches :
        The `findall()` function in Python's `re` module returns all occurrences of a
        pattern within a string as a list.

6. Flags :
        Python's `re` module supports flags that modify the behavior of regular
        expression matching.
        For example, the `re.IGNORECASE` flag can be used to perform case-insensitive
        matching.

RE syntax :

1. Literal Characters:
        Regular expressions can match literal characters exactly as they appear.
        For example, the regular expression `hello` will match the string "hello"
        in the input text.

2. Character Classes:
        Character classes allow you to match one of several characters at a specific
        position. They are defined using square brackets.
        For example, `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.

3. Quantifiers :
   - `*`    : Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `+`    : Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `?`    : Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.
   - `{n}`  : Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `{n,}` : Matches `n` or more occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `{n,m}`: Matches between `n` and `m` occurrences of the preceding element.

4. Anchors :
    - ^ :   This anchor asserts the start of a line or string.
    - $ :   This anchor asserts the end of a line or string.
    - \b:   This anchor matches a word boundary, which is the position between a
            word character (\w) and a non-word character (\W) or vice versa.
    - \B:   This anchor matches a non-word boundary, which is the position between
            two word characters (\w) or two non-word characters (\W).

5. Wildcards :
   - `.`: Matches any single character except newline.

6. Escape Characters:
        Some characters have special meanings in regular expressions. To match them
        literally, you need to escape them using a backslash (`\`). For example,
        `\.` matches a period.

7. Alternation :
   - `|`: Matches either the expression before or after the pipe.

8. Grouping :
   - `()`: Groups multiple tokens together. It also captures the matched text
      so that it can be referenced later.

9. Character Escapes :
   - `\d`: Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
   - `\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).
   - `\s`: Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.).
   - `\D`, `\W`, `\S`: Match the opposite of `\d`, `\w`, `\s` respectively.

10. Modifiers :
    - `i`: Case-insensitive matching.
    - `m`: Multi-line matching (treats beginning and end characters (^ and $) as working on each line rather than the whole string).
    - `s`: Allows the dot (`.`) to match newline characters as well.
    - `x`: Ignores whitespace and allows comments within the pattern.
